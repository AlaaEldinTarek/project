# Login Form 
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description: 
The project is an entry page that was created with HTML code, CSS and Javesscript, and also using the Firebase database.
In the beginning, I wrote the HTML code to divide the form into parts, and after the code was completed, I modified the UI touch by modifying the form using CSS.
Therefore, in order for the code to interact with the user, I did this by using the JavaScript code, and thus I also dealt with the database in order to be connected to it and use the data in it and create data inside it.
Through this page, I can create a new user or create a membership so that I can take a certain permission that will be included later for members.
In this way, the user who used the form to create a new account can use this account at any time because they were created in a database. Through this database, I can add some features to this member or modify anything else in his account later.
